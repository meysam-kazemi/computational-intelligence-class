# computational-intelligence-class
In this repository, I have completed the projects of the computational intelligence course.

Projects:

**Project 1** : Investigating the behavior of the simple model with respect to data that is different from the training data.

**Project 2** : Solving the traveling salesman problem by **Genetic Algorithm**.

**Project 3** : Construction of **"AND"** and **"OR"** and **"XOR"** gates by single-layer neural network.
